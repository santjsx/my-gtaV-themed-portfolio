# Santhosh Reddy - Full Stack Developer Portfolio

A Grand Theft Auto V-themed personal portfolio website engineered as a single-page application. This project demonstrates advanced front-end development skills through an immersive, interactive user interface inspired by the game's HUD and menu systems.

## Overview

- **Responsive Design**: distinct experiences for desktop and mobile devices.

### Navigation
- **Desktop**: Pause Menu-style header navigation with hover effects.
- **Mobile**: iFruit Phone-style overlay menu, optimized for touch interaction.

### Interactive Elements
- **Skill Wheel**: A functional "Weapon Wheel" interface for showcasing technical skills, complete with selection animations and detailed stats.
- **Project Heists**: Project showcase presented as mission planning boards with status indicators and difficulty ratings.
- **Contact Terminal**: A secure communications interface with real-time validation and "Mission Passed" success sequences.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure and layout.
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling, including custom animations and layout handling.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Core logic for navigation, audio, and state management.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling framework for rapid UI development.
